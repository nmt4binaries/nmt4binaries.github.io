      <small>* We previously submitted the paper to NDSS 2018 in August 2017 and S&P 2019 in May 2018, 
      and finally got accepted to NDSS 2019 after significant improvement. 
      However, the main NMT-inspired idea remains the same.

      <h3>Download Embedding Files</h3>
      <p>We have trained three instruction embeddings of which dimension is 50, 100, 150. 
        To further use our Siamese based tool for binaries similarity detection, 
        you should first download them from the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/om0uvkruwj86fuh/AABOkWA5VD7S_WCdQV5D7eq1a?dl=0">link</a>.
      </p>
      <p> Normally, we prefer all instructions can find its embedding in pre-trained .w2v files. 
        If not, any unknown word will be replaced with zero vector.
      </p>

        <h2>SIAMESE MODEL</h2>
      </div>
      
        <h3>Input Data</h3>
        <p>Only well pre-processed data can be accepted by the Siamese neural network based binaries similary detector. 
          To display the usage of Siamese model, we provide some input samples (e.g. test_set_O2.csv) which you can download from the <a href="https://github.com/nmt4binaries/nmt4binaries.github.io/tree/master/download/">link</a>.
        </p>

      <h3>Please note that, according to our NDSS paper, we collect the assembly code via LLVM. Thus, the assembly code in our dataset may be different from those obtained from reverse enginnering tool such as IDA Pro. </h3>
      
      <h3>Pre-trained Model</h3>
      <p>As an example, we provided the pre-trained model weights for a Siamese based binary similarity detector, please click the <a href="https://github.com/nmt4binaries/nmt4binaries.github.io/tree/master/download/">link</a> to download it.
        In detail, each sub-network in such Siamese network is a double-layer LSTM with 100D vector (for each instruction embedding) as input. Please refer to the example script in Python to re-run the test case.

        <h2>Modify LLVM</h2>
      </div>
      
        <p>You can modify the backend of llvm to automatically output the bounderies of basic blocks (in .s file) and assign an identifier for each of them.
           To do that, you need to replace the orginial AsmPrinter.cpp file in llvm project with the one provided <a href="https://github.com/nmt4binaries/nmt4binaries.github.io/tree/master/download/">here</a>.
